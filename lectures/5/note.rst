We can't just live with a single ``main`` function, well, technically you can,
but the obvious shortage is that your ``main`` script will become extremely
large and eventually become unmaintainable.

During the development of your main programs, you main find some of the
functions (in general, interface methods) are very valuable and you want to
reuse them in the future or share with others (great!).
