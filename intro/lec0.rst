Comment! Please Comment...
--------------------------

All programming languages have their way to comment the source
codes. In `Python`_, people use number sign to start a line
of comment

.. code-block:: python

    # This is a comment
    # This is another comment

In `MATLAB`_, people use percentage sign, i.e.

.. code-block:: matlab

    % This is a comment
    %{
    This
    is
    a block of
    comments
    %}

In `C++`_, we use double forward flashes :cpp:`//` to comment, i.e.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // This is a c++ comment
    // Compiler will not read me!

Of course, the old C style comment is also valid, i.e.

.. code-block:: cpp

    /*
    compiler will
    not read
    anything
    in this
    block
    */
